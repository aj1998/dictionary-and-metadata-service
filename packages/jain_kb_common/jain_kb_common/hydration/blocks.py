"""Shared block-projection helpers for the Hindi hydrators.

Both ``hydrate_definitions_hi`` and ``hydrate_topic_extracts_hi`` project the
same parsed ``blocks[]`` shape down to a single Hindi string per block. The
content taxonomy is:

- ``hindi_text``: pure Hindi prose; text lives in ``text_devanagari``, no
  ``hindi_translation``.
- ``prakrit_text`` / ``sanskrit_text`` / ``prakrit_gatha`` / ``sanskrit_gatha``:
  the original scriptural verse lives in ``text_devanagari``; its Hindi meaning
  lives in ``hindi_translation``.
- ``see_also``: cross-reference pointer, no usable text.
- ``table``: structured rows, no inline text.

The earlier hydrators kept only ``{hindi_text, hindi_gatha}`` and read
``text_devanagari``. That dropped every prakrit/sanskrit verse and every gatha
(the real gatha kinds are ``prakrit_gatha`` / ``sanskrit_gatha`` — ``hindi_gatha``
never appears in the data), leaving the Hindi RAG context with empty extracts
even when ``extract_count > 0``. We now keep every block except the excluded
kinds and emit its Hindi meaning (``hindi_translation``), falling back to the
original ``text_devanagari`` when no translation exists.
